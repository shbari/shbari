# Ratting curve
Some algorithom may gives local optima deviating from global best. The initial value plays an important rule in finding best parameters value. please check these fatcs before using any fitting algorithom
#example use:

fit_rating_curve(file_path) 
or 

fit_rating_curve('path/to/your/data.csv', a_initial=0.5, b_initial=1.0, maxfev=1000)


Please ensure that the CSV file contains three columns named 'Time", 'H' for river stage and 'Q' for discharge
